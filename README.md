# flappy_skrrt
just a flappy bird clone I made as my first 3d game (PS: It's full of spaghetti code)
![game icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63875418/124233518-34b3eb00-db13-11eb-9656-3e180df4408d.png)

The icon is pretty bad but I'm learning how to keep it simple and to the point...
